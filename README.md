üîê Secure Auth API with Node.js and Express

This project implements a robust, token-based authentication system using Node.js, Express, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT). It provides secure user registration, login, and protected route access.

‚ú® Features

User Registration: Securely stores user credentials using password hashing (Bcrypt).

User Login: Authenticates users and generates a state-of-the-art JSON Web Token (JWT).

Protected Routes (Middleware): Custom middleware to verify JWTs, ensuring only authenticated users can access specific resources.

Environment Configuration: Utilizes .env files for secure handling of secrets like the JWT key and database connection strings.

Modular Architecture: Clear separation of concerns with routes, controllers, and middleware.

üõ† Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js: (v18+)

npm or Yarn: Package manager

A running MongoDB instance (local or Atlas)

üöÄ Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to get your development environment running:

1. Clone the repository

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/auth-node-express.git](https://github.com/your-username/auth-node-express.git)
cd auth-node-express


2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Node.js packages:

npm install
# or
yarn install


3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a file named .env in the root directory and add the following configuration variables:

# Server Configuration
PORT=3000

# Database Connection (Example using MongoDB/Mongoose)
MONGO_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/authdb"

# Security Secrets (IMPORTANT: Use a long, complex string for production)
JWT_SECRET="YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_JWT_KEY_HERE"


üèÉ Running the Application

Development Mode

Start the server using nodemon (if installed) or standard node:

npm run dev
# or 
node server.js


The server will be running at http://localhost:3000 (or your configured port).

üó∫ API Endpoints

Use a tool like Postman or a simple client to interact with the following endpoints:

Method

Endpoint

Description

Requires Auth

POST

/api/auth/register

Creates a new user account.

‚ùå No

POST

/api/auth/login

Authenticates a user and returns a JWT.

‚ùå No

GET

/api/protected

Accesses a resource only available to authenticated users.

‚úÖ Yes

Example Request Body for Register/Login

{
  "username": "testuser",
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "securePassword123"
}


üîë Security Considerations

Password Hashing: Passwords are never stored in plain text; they are hashed using Bcrypt.

JWT Storage: In a front-end application, the returned JWT should be stored securely (e.g., in localStorage or sessionStorage for convenience, but ideally in HttpOnly cookies for better security against XSS attacks).

Rate Limiting: For production use, it is highly recommended to add rate limiting to the /api/auth/register and /api/auth/login endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks.
